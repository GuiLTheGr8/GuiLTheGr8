### 👋 Hi, I’m Guilherme Vassallo! (@GuiLTheGr8)
## Welcome to my GitHub.

I consider myself to be a deeply creative, critical and passionate person, as well as a gaming, music and storytelling aficionado. 🎮🍔💻🎸🏎 

My biggest professional objective is to create and contribute to digital solutions and digital works of art that
break paradigms and make people reflect about their lives, so they can change their mentality and even the world for the best!

I was born in Nova Friburgo, RJ, Brazil,  but I moved to the city of Rio de Janeiro in order to
find more and better job opportunities in the technology area, with an emphasis in software.

Throughout the years 2018 and 2019, I learned a lot about iOS development and development in general at the 
Apple Developer Academy program, which was an amazing and unforgettable experience, and whose lab is located
alongside the PUC-Rio University, where I'm also studying Information Systems since the second semester of 2016.

In addition, I have concluded a Web Design course at Microlins Nova Friburgo and I speak advanced English and
Basic German apart from Portuguese, which is my main language. I also sing, play the guitar and compose music,
both as a hobby and for personal or non personal projects. I occasionally try to do voice acting as well,
since people say I have a relatively flexible voice.

- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, games, apps, music, sound design and interfaces.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java and Unity (C#) game development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on impactful and creative projects, of whatever kind!
